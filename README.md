Frauds in credit card transactions are common today, thanks to the advancement of technology and increase in online transaction but there is also increase in credit card frauds causing huge loss. Therefore, there’s need for effective methods to detect and prevent frauds. You are encouraged to use the multiple algorithms of Machine learning like support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (Knn) and artificial neural network (ANN) in predicting the occurrence of the fraud. Further, analyze and comment on the results achieved by different machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify fraud and non-fraud transactions.
